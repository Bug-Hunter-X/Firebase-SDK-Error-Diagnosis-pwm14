The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the project is not properly configured or if the necessary APIs are not enabled.  For example, if you are using the Firebase Authentication API, you must enable it in the Firebase console. If you are using the Firebase Realtime Database API, you must enable it in the Firebase console. This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.  A specific example might be attempting to access a database without correctly configuring the database URL in your client-side code.
